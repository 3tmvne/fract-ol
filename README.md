# 🌀 Fract-ol

**Fract-ol** is a project from the 42 curriculum that introduces students to basic graphics programming through the rendering of mathematical fractals using the **MiniLibX** library.

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this project is to generate and display fractals, specifically:

- **Mandelbrot**
- **Julia**

Users can zoom in/out and move around the fractal space using the keyboard and mouse.

## 🧑‍💻 Features

- Render **Mandelbrot** and **Julia** sets.
- Zoom in and out with mouse scroll.
- Move around using arrow keys.
- Adjust Julia set parameters dynamically with mouse movement (only for Julia).
- Close the window with the `ESC` key or the window close button.

## 🧰 Technologies

- Language: **C**
- Library: **MiniLibX**
- OS: **macOS** or **Linux** (with X11)

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/3tmvne/fractol.git
